# Filter MetaFilter

This is a WebExtension for Firefox that allows you to sort or hide MetaFilter comments based on their number of favorites. This is not how the site was meant to be used, but it might help distill the largest threads down to the most popular comments for a quick overview of what comments got lots of attention. It's also an excuse for me to write a browser extension since I don't have any other ideas for extensions right now. It's a WebExtension so it will work on FireFox for Android.

## QYMAOMNIDKYL - Questions You Might Ask, Or Might Not, I Don't Know Your Life

## How do I undo sorting or filtering?

At the moment there's no Undo option. Refreshing the page will undo the sort or filter.

## Doesn't this break MetaFilter, since each MeFi comment thread is one big thread instead of having sub-threads?

Yes, it does. This is not useful for reading an entire MetaFilter thread as it will take most comments out of context. It's mostly an excuse for me to write a Firefox extension. In a really popular thread it might be interesting to see which comments got the most Favorites, but that's all.

The Filter option might be useful if a really, really big thread is giving your device performance problems (as often happens on phones) - it actually deletes the comments from your browser's memory and so may free up resources and make things slightly faster. However, it can only do this once the page is loaded so it can't speed up the initial load which is the biggest performance problem so it's not a solution to the long load time of a really big thread. I also haven't tested to see if it actually has a real-life performance benefit, so the benefits are theoretical for now and likely marginal in reality.
